# Show-Up_Project
In this project I tried to analyze the data and I did this through five steps :
1- Explore Data : In this step I knew features of data and found statistical describe of data.
2- Cleaning Data : In this step I searched for null values & duplicated values to deal with them and also I solved the problem of Age column because there was a value less than zero and there are some values equal zero so I solved this issue in this step.
3- Asking & Answering Questions : In this step I tried to find the answer of (3) questions I asked about data :
a) What is the Count of people went to the appointment and people didn't go to the appointment ?
b) Is there any relation between showing up and gender or not ?
c) What is the number of patients with diabetes & handcap & hiprtension and what is percentages of them ?
4- After I answered question I made some plots to visualize my result and I took help from google at some pieces of code such as :
(color & size of bar plot from link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bar-plot-in-matplotlib/)
(color & size of pie chart from link : https://datatofish.com/pie-chart-matplotlib/)
5- Conclusion : I found that number of attendance is almost 1/4 the number of not attendence ;
I also found that there is no relation of gender and attendance the appointment because the percentage of males is almost equal to the percentage of females ;
And finally when I calculated the number of patients I found that patients with hipertension diagnose are the high number and percentage of all patients.
